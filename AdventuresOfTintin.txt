The Great Flea Market of Place du Jeu de Balle...



A peaceful yet lively location, filled with the buzz of the people and the many treasures that local vendors would sell. Be it brand-new merchandise or used goods such as old books, collectibles, vintage clothing, or beautiful antiques that were waiting to gain a second chance in life.



Among the many sellers, was an artist in the heart of the market who was sitting in front of his easel with his newest masterpiece taking shape.



"Very nearly there, sir." He informed his newest customer with a thick French accent as his brush danced upon the sheet of paper.



"I have to say, your face is familiar. Have I drawn you before?"



"Occasionally."



A bright shine came to the Artist's eyes. "Of course! I have seen you in the newspaper."



He turned back to his drawing with a fire of great enthusiasm.





"You are a reporter?"



"I'm a journalist." Tintin corrected as he sat still on the stool.



Snowy whimpered a little, so he patted his head in comfort. "Be patient, Snowy. Not much longer."



Snowy let out a disgruntled whine, but he obeyed. Shifting his gaze, he entertained himself by looking at the big crowd of people.





A pair of feet caught his attention. They were rocking back and forth like a giddy little child. Soft chuckles also followed that strange occurrence which made Snowy look up.



It was a man in fancy clothing. He tilted his head in confusion when he noticed the black gloves on the stranger's hands. The man's fingers wiggled excitedly before he walked forward with an air of confidence.
